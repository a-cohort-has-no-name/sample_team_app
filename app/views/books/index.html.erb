<h1>Vacation</h1>
<body>
  <p>Can't seem to get my mind off of you
  Back here at home there's nothin' to do
  Now that I'm away
  I wish I'd stayed
  Tomorrow's a day of mine
  That you won't be in

  When you looked at me
  I should've run
  But I thought it was just for fun
  I see I was wrong
  And I'm not so strong
  I should've known all along
  That time would tell

  A week without you
  Thought I'd forget
  Two weeks without you and I
  Still haven't gotten over you yet

  Vacation
  All I ever wanted
  Vacation
  Had to get away
  Vacation
  Meant to be spent alone

  Vacation
  All I ever wanted
  Vacation
  Had to get away
  Vacation
  Meant to be spent alone

  [Instrumental Interlude]

  A week without you
  Thought I'd forget
  Two weeks without you and I
  Still haven't gotten over you yet

  Vacation
  All I ever wanted
  Vacation
  Had to get away
  Vacation
  Meant to be spent alone

  Vacation
  All I ever wanted
  Vacation
  Had to get away
  Vacation
  Meant to be spent alone

  Vacation
  All I ever wanted
  Vacation
  Had to get away
  Vacation
  Meant to be spent alone</p>
